# Bitcoin Mining Process

This directory contains a JavaScript implementation of Bitcoin mining that demonstrates how the process works at a fundamental level.

## How Bitcoin Mining Works

Bitcoin mining is the process of creating new blocks for the Bitcoin blockchain. Here's the step-by-step process:

### 1. Get Block Template from Network
- Connect to a Bitcoin Core node via RPC
- Request a "block template" that tells you what the next block should contain
- This includes:
  - Previous block's hash (links to the existing chain)
  - List of pending transactions to include
  - Target difficulty (how hard the puzzle is)
  - Coinbase reward amount (currently 3.125 BTC)
  - Current timestamp requirements

### 2. Build the Coinbase Transaction
- Create a special "coinbase" transaction that pays the mining reward to yourself
- This transaction has no inputs (it creates new Bitcoin)
- Output goes to your Bitcoin address
- Include any transaction fees from other transactions

### 3. Calculate Merkle Root
- Take all transactions (including your coinbase transaction)
- Build a "merkle tree" - a mathematical structure that creates a single hash representing all transactions
- This ensures no one can change the transactions without changing the merkle root

### 4. Construct Block Header
- Build an 80-byte data structure containing:
  - **Version**: Protocol version number
  - **Previous Hash**: Hash of the previous block (32 bytes)
  - **Merkle Root**: Hash representing all transactions (32 bytes)
  - **Timestamp**: When this block was created (4 bytes)
  - **Difficulty Bits**: Current network difficulty target (4 bytes)
  - **Nonce**: Random number you change to find solution (4 bytes)

### 5. Hash the Block Header
- Take the 80-byte block header
- Run it through SHA-256 twice (this is Bitcoin's hash function)
- Result is a 32-byte hash that looks like: `4afccbd7c9d5354030e7bd1682b988ae...`

### 6. Check if Hash Meets Target
- Compare your hash to the network's target difficulty
- Target looks like: `0000000000000000000211ac000000000000000000...`
- Your hash must be **less than** this target (mathematically smaller)
- Currently requires about 19 leading zeros

### 7. If Hash Doesn't Meet Target
- Increment the nonce by 1 (or change timestamp)
- Go back to step 5 and hash again
- Repeat millions/billions of times until you find a winning hash

### 8. If Hash Meets Target - You Win!
- Submit your complete block to the network
- Other nodes verify your work
- If valid, your block gets added to the blockchain
- You receive the coinbase reward (3.125 BTC + transaction fees)

## The Challenge

The network automatically adjusts difficulty every 2,016 blocks (~2 weeks) to maintain 10-minute average block times. Currently:

- **Difficulty**: ~136 trillion
- **Required hashes**: ~584 sextillion attempts on average
- **Network hash rate**: ~800 exahashes per second
- **Your odds**: Essentially zero with consumer hardware

Modern miners use specialized ASIC chips running at 100+ terahashes per second. A JavaScript miner might achieve 1-10 thousand hashes per second.

## What This Implementation Does

Our JavaScript miner demonstrates each step:
1. âœ… Connects to Bitcoin Core RPC
2. âœ… Fetches real block templates
3. âœ… Builds proper 80-byte block headers
4. âœ… Performs double SHA-256 hashing
5. âœ… Validates against network target
6. ðŸ”„ Ready for nonce iteration loop

While it won't find blocks on mainnet, it shows exactly how Bitcoin mining works under the hood.
